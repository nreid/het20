# alignment and variant calling on new heteroclitus WGS data

- ref genome is Reid et al. 2017
- ref genome, sequencing data are symlinked to genome, data directories
- older WGS from Reid et al. 2016 and Oziolor et al. 2019 aligned to the same reference are used here. They're symlinked into results/alignment
